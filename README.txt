Signals and Systems
Make sure to extract all the files from the zip before running them or they won't be able to use the codependent files
This also means all of the files must remain in the same directory to work properly

Order to run files:
1. Telephone_part_B.m
2. MusicalScales_part_C.m
3. PlayingNotes_part_D.m
4. PlayingSong_Part_E.mlapp -- If it doesn't work use the PlayingSongBackup.m file
5. frequency_estimation.m -- Run as function
6. mpeg_detector.m -- optional, did for fun
