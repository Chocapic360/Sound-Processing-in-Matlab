# Sound Processing in Matlab
### ENGR 30503 ‚Äì Signals and Systems  
### Texas Christian University ‚Äì Fall 2025  

This repository implements digital sound synthesis and signal processing in **MATLAB**. It covers musical note generation, DTMF dialing, ADSR instrument envelopes, melody playback, and frequency analysis using the Fourier Transform.

## üìö Project Overview

This project explores how sound can be digitally created and manipulated as 1D signals in MATLAB. Core topics include:

- Generating sinusoidal tones
- Combining and modifying sound signals
- Building musical scales
- Applying **ADSR** (Attack‚ÄìDecay‚ÄìSustain‚ÄìRelease) envelopes
- Simulating **telephone DTMF dialing**
- Playing songs like *Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star*
- Frequency analysis with the **FFT**

Based on the assignment specification from the course project document.
